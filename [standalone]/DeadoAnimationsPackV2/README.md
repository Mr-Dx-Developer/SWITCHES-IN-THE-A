# Menu Keybind üéõÔ∏è

**Important Note:**

The keybind uses RegisterKeyMapping. By default, the server owner configured keybind in the *initial* config.lua will be the default key, however once the keybind is set for a user, it'll stay with this new value. Editing the config keybind will change it for new players only.


**Menu key:** F5

Server Owners can change this in the `config.lua`.

Alternatively, the player base can set their own menu keybind to open DpEmotes

Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem > dpemotes

* More keybinds are now using key mappings which means that they are now available in your FiveM settings to change (`FavKeybind` and `RagdollKeybind`)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Keybinds and SQL üéõÔ∏è

The original dpemotes uses mysql-async which was then changed to ghmattimysql. Unfortunately, they are no longer maintained. 

To use the SQL features, install the [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql) resource. If you do not want to use the SQL features, comment out the `oxmysql` region in fxmanifest.lua.

Alternatively, you can use the keybind command that comes with FiveM without having the SQL, by entering the following into F8: 

`bind keyboard "Yourbutton" "e youremote"`. To remove the keybind, type `"unbind keyboard "Yourbutton"`.

-------------------------------------------------

# Ragdoll ü•¥

* To enable ragdoll, change `RagdollEnabled = false,` to true in config.lua.

Much like the menu key, `RagdollKeybind` is also using RegisterKeyMapping. It is currently set to `U` by default *(server side)* however can be set to the player's preferred keybind in the FiveM keybinds setting found in the settings menu within the Esc Menu.

* New setting: `RagdollAsToggle`, this will make either the ragdoll be a toggle or a hold key

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adult Emotes üîû

Adult Emotes can be hidden from the menu by setting `AdultEmotesDisabled` to `true` in the config.lua file.

This will completely conceal the emotes from the lists *(Emotes, Shared Emotes, etc)* at startup making them unusable.

The emotes that are concealed, are the ones flagged in the animation list with `AdultAnimation`. You can see how it is done with `fspose`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# QBCore ‚öôÔ∏è

* QBCore integration to match their fork of the original dpemotes**

- Config option which supports the QB Framework in their fork of dpemotes

If you‚Äôre using qb-core, you can now set `Framework = "qb-core"` in the config file, otherwise leave it as `false`.

* [Enforce gamebuild to latest build](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-or-tuners-update/4784977) for all emotes and props to work correctly
* Set the desired language and settings in the config.lua

# Shared emotes üë©üèª‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üèº

Emotes will work with either `SyncOffset` or `Attachto`.

* If it is with `SyncOffsetFront` or `SyncOffsetSide`, then the offset used is the one of the emote the player started.<br/>
For example, if player one starts the emote `handshake` which has `SyncOffsetFront`, then player one will have the `SyncOffsetFront` but not the other player.


* If it is with `Attachto`, then it'll either be player one's data used for attaching, or the player two's data.<br/>
For example, if player one start the emote carry, then the other player will be attached but not the player one because Attachto is set in `carry2` and not `carry`.<br/>

* If player one starts the emote `carry2`, then player one will be attached and not the other player.
it's the player who start the animation who will in most cases be moved


* Special case, if both emote have the `Attachto` then only the player who started the emote will be attached.*

You can find a list of ped bones to attach the other player here: [Ped Bones](https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Bones)

Using the website provided above, enter the bone ID, ie `1356` and not `111`, which is the Bone Index.
