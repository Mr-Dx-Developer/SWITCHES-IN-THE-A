-- QUESTION:   What are my credentials?
-- ANSWER:     Your credentials are related to your receipt from https://modit.store.
--             This is not the paypal receipt, but the receipt you receive directly from modit.store.
--             Your site receipt can be found in your purchase history.

-- QUESTION:   What is my receipt?
-- ANSWER:     Your receipt (as listed in the table below) is the 4 digit number attached to your order on the website.
--             Again, this has nothing to do with your paypal receipt. Both email and receipt are attached to your modit.store order.
--             It will be presented on the site as, for example: 
--             #1234
--             Below, you would set
--             Receipt = '1234',

Credentials = {
  Receipt = "CHANGEME",
  Email   = "CHANGEME"
}
