# kq_priv_islands INSTALLATION GUIDE [ESX]

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the kq_priv_islands script for FiveM. This script requires the ESX framework to be installed and running on your server.

## Step 1:
After downloading the script, unzip the folder and place it in the `resources` directory on your FiveM server. Make sure to also install `kq_islands_props`

## Step 2:
Next, you need to import the `kq_priv_islands.sql` file into your database. This will create the tables required for the script to function properly. You can watch this video for instructions on how to import an SQL file into your database: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbqDLXrZGY.

## Step 3:
Once the SQL file has been imported, open the `config.lua` file in the script folder and make sure that the correct framework and sql driver is set.

## Step 4:
After the config file has been set up, add the script to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's added **after** the ESX framework, so that it loads and starts properly.

## Done
Enjoy the script
