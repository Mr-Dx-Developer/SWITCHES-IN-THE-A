[QB/ESX] Let's Cook Plus! 

Discord: https://discord.gg/xmmx-scripts - for my script support only! Please ensure you have followed all install directions below and are using the required dependencies before requesting support. Support will NOT be provided if you are not using the correct dependencies in order for the script to work properly. You must also have claimed your role confirming purchase.

We offer support via Discord Monday - Friday, but responses are limited as we do work fulltime jobs and have families as well. We try to answer questions as soon as possible but guarantee a response within 7 business days.

## DO NOT INSTALL WITHOUT FIRST READING AND FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW OR YOU WILL HAVE ERRORS! THIS IS NOT A DRAG AND DROP SCRIPT. YOU MUST CONFIGURE IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK PROPERLY.

## THE NUMBER ONE ERROR USERS HAVE IS WHEN THEY SKIP OVER THE INSTALLATION STEPS. We will not provide support for custom integrations or changes to the script. Please have your developer do this for you if you are not familiar with lua coding.





INSTALLATION: (Please follow the steps for installation on our documentations page linked below.)
